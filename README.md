- ⚡ Fun fact: ...
--> Hi! I’m Ada — I love wearing many hats (metaphorically).
When I’m not juggling responsibilities, you’ll find me hosting events, choreographing dances, or confidently winging it on stage (somehow it works 😄).
I thrive in creative, collaborative spaces and genuinely enjoy connecting with people and bringing energy into everything I do.
